# Music Artist Networking Site:
This is a Music artist website which will provide artist detail to promoters, club owners, and concert venues as well as giving them the option to upload their own artist to the website. There will be a login function with username and password in order to protect music artist information from individuals outside the music industry.  The following information is available per the artist. 

* Name
* Bio
* Location

* Memberships
* Image
* Videos (possible) - django-embed-video
* Personal Website

# Project Design Features:
The project will be built in Python and Django for both frontend and backend. I will utilize the framework 'Pillow' to add images to the site as uploads. 

# Backend:
I will use postgres SQL. 

# Frontend: 
I will use Django Templates and build them out within the application
The possibility to add - django-embed-video - I will try to add as well.
